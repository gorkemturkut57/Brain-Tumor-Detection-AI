This project aims to automatically detect brain tumors using medical images. Brain tumors, abnormal cell growths in the brain, can be benign or malignant. Early diagnosis is crucial, especially for malignant tumors. Using MRI images and deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model has been developed to detect brain tumors, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
