# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

This project aims to automatically detect brain tumors using medical images. Brain tumors are defined as abnormal cell growths in any part of the brain. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Malignant tumors are generally more dangerous and can grow rapidly, which increases the importance of early diagnosis. The diagnosis of brain tumors is typically performed using advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, interpreting these images requires expertise and is prone to errors.
In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model has been developed to detect brain tumors using deep learning methods. Using this model, artificial intelligence has been trained to detect brain tumors.
